  abstract    = {Future giant liquid argon (LAr) time projection chambers (TPCs) require a purity of better than 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) to allow the ionised electrons to drift without significant capture by any electronegative impurities. We present a comprehensive study of the effects of electronegative impurity on gaseous and liquid argon scintillation light, an analysis of the efficacy of various purification chemicals, as well as the Liverpool LAr setup, which utilises a novel re-circulation purification system. Of the impurities tested - Air, O_2, H_2O, N_2 and CO_2 in the range of between 0.01 ppm to 1000 ppm - H_2O was found to have the most profound effect on gaseous argon scintillation light, and N_2 was found to have the least. Additionally, a correlation between the slow component decay time and the total energy deposited with 0.01 ppm - 100 ppm O_2 contamination levels in liquid argon has been established. The superiority of molecular sieves over anhydrous complexes at absorbing Ar gas, N_2 gas and H_2O vapour has been quantified using BET isotherm analysis. The efficiency of Cu and P_2O5 at removing O_2 and H_2O impurities from 1 bar N6 argon gas at both room temperature and -130 ^oC was investigated and found to be high. A novel, highly scalable LAr re-circulation system has been developed. The complete system, consisting of a motorised bellows pump operating in liquid and a purification cartridge, were designed and built in-house. The system was operated successfully over many days and achieved a re-circulation rate of 27 litres/hour and high purity.},

  title        = {Electron emission properties of two-phase argon and argon-nitrogen avalanche detectors},
  abstract     = {Electron emission properties of two-phase Ar avalanche detectors are studied. The detectors investigated comprised a liquid Ar or Ar+N2 layer followed by a multi-GEM multiplier operated in the saturated vapour at 84 K. Two components of the electron emission through the liquid-gas interface were observed: fast and slow. In Ar, the slow emission component dominated even at higher fields, reaching 2 kV/cm. In Ar+N2 on the contrary, the fast emission component dominated at higher fields, the slow component being disappeared. This is explained by the electron backscattering effect in the gas phase. The slow component decay time constant was inversely proportional to the electric field, which is compatible with thermionic emission model. The electron emission efficiencies in two-phase Ar and Ar+N2 were estimated to be close to each other.},

  title       = {Performance study of the effective gain of the double phase liquid Argon LEM Time Projection Chamber},
  abstract    = {The Large Electron Multipliers (LEMs) are key components of double phase liquid argon TPCs. The drifting charges after being extracted from the liquid are amplified in the LEM positioned half a centimeter above the liquid in pure argon vapor at 87 K. The LEM is characterised by the size of its dielectric rim around the holes, the thickness of the LEM insulator, the diameter of the holes as well as their geometrical layout. The impact of those design parameters on the amplification were checked by testing seven different LEMs with an active area of 10$\times$10 cm$^2$ in a double phase liquid argon TPC of 21 cm drift. We studied their response in terms of maximal reachable gain and impact on the collected charge uniformity as well as the long term stability of the gain. We show that we could reach maximal gains of around 150 which corresponds to a signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$) of about 800 for a minimal ionising particle (MIP) signal on 3 mm readout strips. We could also conclude that the dielectric surfaces in the vicinity of the LEM holes charge up with different time constants that depend on their design parameters. Our results demonstrate that the LAr LEM TPC is a robust concept that is well-understood and well-suited for operation in ultra-pure cryogenic environments and that can match the goals of future large-scale liquid argon detectors.},

  abstract    = {This document presents the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) put forward by an international neutrino community to pursue the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF/DUNE), a groundbreaking science experiment for long-baseline neutrino oscillation studies and for neutrino astrophysics and nucleon decay searches. The DUNE far detector will be a very large modular liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) located deep underground, coupled to the LBNF multi-megawatt wide-band neutrino beam. DUNE will also have a high-resolution and high-precision near detector.},

In light of this, we refine a previous analysis of the sensitivity to leptonic CP violation at a neutrino factory, in the LMA-MSW scenario, by exploring the full range of $\delta$ and $\theta_{13}$. Furthermore, we take into account the expected uncertainties on the solar and atmospheric oscillation parameters and in the average Earth matter density along the neutrino path. An intermediate baseline of O(3000) km is still the best option to tackle CP violation, although a combination of two baselines turns out to be very important in resolving degeneracies.},

Neutrino factories require large magnetized detectors. New generation superbeams or beta-beams need giant detectors. The liquid Argon TPC technology has great potentials for both applications. Although the ICARUS program has demonstrated that this technology is mature, the possibility to built a giant liquid argon TPC is viewed by many as a technically impossible and unsafe task. We argue that a giant liquid argon Cerenkov and charge Imaging experiment would be an ideal match for a superbeam or a betabeam. Such a detector would in addition cover a broad physics program, including the observation of atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, supernova neutrinos, and search for proton decays, in addition to the accelerator physics program. We show a potential implementation of such a giant LAr detector and argue that it could be technically feasible. The possibility to host such a detector in an underground cavern is under study.},

  title        = {On the energy and baseline optimization to study effects related to the $δ$-phase (CP-/T-violation) in neutrino oscillations at a Neutrino Factory},
  abstract     = {In this paper we discuss the detection of CP and T-violation effects in the framework of a neutrino factory. We introduce three quantities, which are good discriminants for a non vanishing complex phase ($\delta$) in the $3\times 3$ neutrino mixing matrix. We find that these three discriminants (in vacuum) all scale with $L/E_{\nu}$. Matter effects modify the scaling, but these effects are large enough to spoil the sensitivity only for baselines larger than 5000 km. So, in the hypothesis of constant neutrino factory power, the sensitivity on the $\delta$-phase is independent of the baseline chosen. Specially interesting is the direct measurement of T-violation from the ``wrong-sign'' electron channel, which involves a comparison of the $\nue\ra\numu$ and $\numu\ra\nue$ oscillation rates. However, the $\numu\ra\nue$ measurement requires magnetic discrimination of the electron charge, experimentally very challenging in a neutrino detector: low-energy neutrino beams and hence short baselines, are preferred. In this paper we show the exclusion regions in the $\Delta m^2_{12} - \delta$ plane for two concrete cases. We obtain a similar excluded region provided that the electron detection efficiency is $\sim$20% and the charge confusion 0.1%. The $\Delta m^2_{12}$ compatible with the LMA solar data can be tested with a flux of 5$\times 10^{21}$ muons. We compare these results with the fit of the visible energy distributions.},

We also comment on recent attempts to account for these results and to understand flavour from first principles. We discuss extensively the prospects for probing the strength of CP violation in two near term accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, T2K and NOvA, as well as possible extensions such as T2KK and a second large off-axis detector near the NOvA detector. We also briefly discuss the possibility of probing the effect of Majorana phases in future neutrinoless double beta decay searches and discuss other implications of leptonic CP violation such as leptogenesis. Finally we comment on the issue of robustness of the current oscillation interpretation and possible ways of probing for non-standard neutrino interactions in precision oscillation studies.},

The main notions related to the effect, its dynamics and physical picture are reviewed. The large mixing MSW effect is realized inside the Sun providing the solution of the solar neutrino problem. The small mixing MSW effect driven by the 1-3 mixing can be realized for the supernova (SN) neutrinos. Inside the collapsing stars new elements of the MSW dynamics may show up: the non-oscillatory transition, non-adiabatic conversion, time dependent adiabaticity violation induced by shock waves. Effects of the resonance enhancement and the parametric enhancement of oscillations can be realized for the atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos in the Earth. Precise results for neutrino oscillations in the low density medium with arbitrary density profile are presented and the attenuation effect is described. The area of applications is the solar and SN neutrinos inside the Earth, and the results are crucial for the neutrino oscillation tomography.},

The detector has a maximum drift length of 60 cm and the readout consists of a $40\times 76$ cm$^2$ LEM and 2D projective anode to multiply and collect drifting charges. Scintillation light is detected by means of cryogenic PMTs positioned below the cathode. To record both charge and light signals, we have developed a compact acquisition system, which is scalable up to ton-scale detectors with thousands of charge readout channels. The acquisition system, as well as the design and the performance of custom-made charge sensitive preamplifiers, are described. The complete experimental setup has been operated for a first time during a period of four weeks at CERN in the cryostat of the ArDM experiment, which was equipped with liquid and gas argon purification systems. The detector, exposed to cosmic rays, recorded events with a single-channel signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 30 for minimum ionising particles. Cosmic muon tracks and their $\delta$-rays were used to assess the performance of the detector, and to estimate the liquid argon purity and the gain at different amplification fields.},

Subsequently, the multi-dimensional case is analysed and sufficient conditions for the exact observability are provided when the boundary subset of observation varies in time. In particular, a previous result obtained by the authors is extended. In the last section, the multi-dimensional results are applied to specific situations and some interconnections between the one and multi-dimensional case are discussed; furthermore some interesting problems are presented.},

  title        = {Michel Electron Reconstruction Using Cosmic-Ray Data from the MicroBooNE LArTPC},
  abstract     = {The MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) has been taking data at Fermilab since 2015 collecting, in addition to neutrino beam, cosmic-ray muons. Results are presented on the reconstruction of Michel electrons produced by the decay at rest of cosmic-ray muons. Michel electrons are abundantly produced in the TPC, and given their well known energy spectrum can be used to study MicroBooNE's detector response to low-energy electrons (electrons with energies up to ~50 MeV). We describe the fully-automated algorithm developed to reconstruct Michel electrons, with which a sample of ~14,000 Michel electron candidates is obtained. Most of this article is dedicated to studying the impact of radiative photons produced by Michel electrons on the accuracy and resolution of their energy measurement. In this energy range, ionization and bremsstrahlung photon production contribute similarly to electron energy loss in argon, leading to a complex electron topology in the TPC. By profiling the performance of the reconstruction algorithm on simulation we show that the ability to identify and include energy deposited by radiative photons leads to a significant improvement in the energy measurement of low-energy electrons. The fractional energy resolution we measure improves from over 30% to ~20% when we attempt to include radiative photons in the reconstruction. These studies are relevant to a large number of analyses which aim to study neutrinos by measuring electrons produced by $\nu_e$ interactions over a broad energy range.},

  abstract    = {In June 2012, an Expression of Interest for a long-baseline experiment (LBNO) has been submitted to the CERN SPSC. LBNO considers three types of neutrino detector technologies: a double-phase liquid argon (LAr) TPC and a magnetised iron detector as far detectors. For the near detector, a high-pressure gas TPC embedded in a calorimeter and a magnet is the baseline design. A mandatory milestone is a concrete prototyping effort towards the envisioned large-scale detectors, and an accompanying campaign of measurements aimed at assessing the detector associated systematic errors. The proposed $6\times 6\times 6$m$^3$ DLAr is an industrial prototype of the design discussed in the EoI and scalable to 20 kton or 50~kton. It is to be constructed and operated in a controlled laboratory and surface environment with test beam access, such as the CERN North Area (NA). Its successful operation and full characterisation will be a fundamental milestone, likely opening the path to an underground deployment of larger detectors. The response of the DLAr demonstrator will be measured and understood with an unprecedented precision in a charged particle test beam (0.5-20 GeV/c). The exposure will certify the assumptions and calibrate the response of the detector, and allow to develop and to benchmark sophisticated reconstruction algorithms, such as those of 3-dimensional tracking, particle ID and energy flow in liquid argon. All these steps are fundamental for validating the correctness of the physics performance described in the LBNO EoI.},

  abstract    = {The dual phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) is the state-of-art technology for neutrino detection thanks to its superb 3D tracking and calorimetry performance. Its main feature is the charge amplification in gas argon which provides excellent signal-to-noise ratio. Electrons produced in the liquid argon are extracted in the gas phase. Here, a readout plane based on Large Electron Multiplier detectors provides amplification of the charges before its collection onto an anode with strip readout. The charge amplification enables constructing fully homoge- nous giant LAr-TPCs with tuneable gain, excellent charge imaging performance and increased sensitivity to low energy events. Following a staged approach the WA105 collaboration is con- structing a dual phase LAr-TPC with an active volume of 3x1x1m3 that will soon be tested with cosmic rays. Its construction and operation aims to test scalable solutions for the crucial aspects of this technology: ultra high argon purity in non-evacuable tank, large area dual phase charge readout system in several square meter scale, and accessible cold front-end electronics. A mile- stone was achieved last year in the completion of the 24 m3 cryostat that hosts the TPC. This is the first cryostat based on membrane technology to be constructed at CERN and is therefore also an important step towards the realisation of the upcoming protoDUNE detectors. The 3x1x1m3 dual phase LAr-TPC will be described in and we will report on the latest construction progress.},

  abstract    = {We report on the successful operation of a double phase Liquid Argon Large Electron Multiplier Time Projection Chamber (LAr LEM-TPC) equipped with two dimensional projective anodes with dimensions 10$\times$10 cm$^2$, and with a maximum drift length of 21 cm. The anodes were manufactured for the first time from a single multilayer printed circuit board (PCB). Various layouts of the readout views have been tested and optimised. In addition, the ionisation charge was efficiently extracted from the liquid to the gas phase with a single grid instead of two previously. We studied the response and the gain of the detector to cosmic muon tracks. To study long-term stability over several weeks, we continuously operated the chamber at fixed electric field settings. We reproducibly observe that after an initial decrease with a characteristic time of $\tau\approx 1.6$ days, the observed gain is stable. In 46 days of operation, a total of 14.6 million triggers have been collected at a stable effective gain of $G_\infty\sim 15$ corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio $(S/N)\gtrsim 60$ for minimum ionising tracks. During the full period, eight discharges across the LEM were observed. A maximum effective gain of 90 was also observed, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio $(S/N)\gtrsim 400$ for minimum ionising tracks, or $S/N\approx10$ for an energy deposition of 15 keV on a single readout channel.},

  abstract    = {We successfully operated a novel kind of LAr Time Projection Chamber based on a Large Electron Multiplier (LEM) readout system. The prototype, of about 3 liters active volume, is operated in liquid-vapour (double) phase pure Ar. The ionization electrons, after drifting in the LAr volume, are extracted by a set of grids into the gas phase and driven into the holes of a double stage LEM, where charge amplification occurs. Each LEM is a thick macroscopic hole multiplier of 10x10 cm$^2$ manufactured with standard PCB techniques. The electrons signal is readout via two orthogonal coordinates, one using the induced signal on the segmented upper electrode of the LEM itself and the other by collecting the electrons on a segmented anode. Custom-made preamplifiers have been especially developed for this purpose. Cosmic ray tracks have been successfully observed in pure gas at room temperature and in double phase Ar operation. We believe that this proof of principle represents an important milestone in the realization of very large, long drift (cost-effective) LAr detectors for next generation neutrino physics and proton decay experiments, as well as for direct search of Dark Matter with imaging devices.},

Electron avalanching is provided by Micro-Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) multipliers, in particular GEMs and THGEMs, operated at cryogenic temperatures in dense noble gases. The final goal for this kind of detectors is the development of large-volume detectors of ultimate sensitivity for rare-event experiments and medical applications, such as coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, direct dark matter search, astrophysical (solar and supernova) neutrino detection experiments and Positron Emission Tomography technique. This review is the first attempt to summarize the results on CRAD performances obtained by different groups. A brief overview of the available CRAD concepts is also given and the most remarkable CRAD physics effects are discussed.},

The millimeter-scale hole-size results in good electron transport and in large avalanche-multiplication factors, e.g. reaching 10^7 in double-THGEM cascaded single-photoelectron detectors. The multiplier's material, parameters and shape can be application-tailored; it can operate practically in any counting gas, including noble gases, over a pressure range spanning from 1 mbar to several bars; its operation at cryogenic (LAr) conditions was recently demonstrated. The high gain, sub-millimeter spatial resolution, high counting-rate capability, good timing properties and the possibility of industrial production capability of large-area robust detectors, pave ways towards a broad spectrum of potential applications; some are discussed here in brief.},

A figure of merit argument is used to show that our ability to measure the phase \delta is rather insensitive to the value of \theta_{13} (for \sin^22\theta_{13}\gsim0.01) as well as the detector distance (for very long oscillation baselines). Using a study of \nu_\mu\to\nu_e oscillations for BNL-Homestake (2540 km) we show that a conventional horn focused wide band neutrino beam generated by an intense 1-2 MW proton source combined with a very large water Cherenkov detector (250-500 kton) should be able to determine \delta to about \pm 15^\circ$ in 5\times 10^7sec of running. In addition, such an effort would also measure the other oscillation parameters (\theta_{ij},\Delta m^2_{ij}) with high precision. Similar findings apply to a Fermilab-Homestake (1280 km)baseline. We also briefly discuss features of Superbeams, Neutrino Factories and Beta-Beams.},
